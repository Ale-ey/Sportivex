## 5. Swimming Pool

### How It Works

The swimming pool uses time slots throughout the day. Some slots are for males only, some for females only, and some are mixed. Faculty and postgraduate students also have dedicated slots.

### Viewing Time Slots

1. Go to Sports then Swimming
2. You'll see the weekly schedule showing:
   - Days and times
   - Who can use each slot (Male/Female/Mixed/Faculty-PG)
   - How many spots are available
   - Trainer names

### Checking In

When you arrive at the pool:
1. Open Sportivex on your phone
2. Go to Swimming and click "Scan QR Code"
3. Scan the QR code at the reception desk
4. The system will check you in automatically

The system follows the 10-minute rule. If you arrive within 10 minutes before a slot starts, you'll be checked into that upcoming slot. If you arrive during a slot, you'll be checked into the current one.

You can only check in once per day. There's no checkout - you stay checked in for the whole session.

### Gender-Based Rules

The system checks your profile to make sure you can access the time slot. If you try to check into a restricted slot, you'll get an error message.

### When the Pool is Full

If a time slot reaches capacity:
1. You can join the waitlist
2. Go to the full time slot and click "Join Waitlist"
3. You'll get a position number
4. The system updates your position automatically as spots open up

To leave the waitlist, go to "My Waitlist" and click "Leave Waitlist".

### Your History

Check "My History" in the Swimming section to see all your past visits with dates, times, and how you checked in.

### Pool Rules

Read the rules and regulations in the Swimming section. They cover safety guidelines, dress codes, and facility rules.
